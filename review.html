        <h1>gta5</h1>

        <p class="p1">Where do you begin talking about Grand Theft Auto V? Do you start with the vast, varied, beautiful open world? Do you start with the innovative structure that gives you three independent protagonists you can switch between on the fly? 
          Maybe you talk about the assortment of side activities you can engage in, or the tremendous number of ways in which you can go about making your own fun. 
          Or perhaps you dive right into the game’s story problems, or its serious issues with women.
           GTA V is a complicated and fascinating game, one that fumbles here and there and has an unnecessary strain of misogynistic nastiness running through it.
            But it also does amazing things no other open-world game has attempted before, using multiple perspectives to put you in the thick of cinematic heist sequences and other exhilarating, multi-layered missions like no open-world game before.</p>
            <br>
            Those perspectives come courtesy of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor.
             Michael’s a former criminal who’s dissatisfied with his current life of privilege and relaxation.
              His marriage is on the rocks and he struggles to connect with his shallow daughter Tracey, who dreams of making it big in reality TV, and with his lazy, entitled son Jimmy, who spends most of his time spouting hate-filled trash talk while playing video games online.
               Franklin’s a talented young driver and repo man who doesn’t seem to have too many opportunities to move up in the world, until he has a chance meeting with Michael.
                Michael finds Franklin easier to connect with than his own children, and he promptly takes him under his wing and ushers him into a life of big-time crime.

        <h1>league of legends</h1>
        <h5><img class= memoji1 src="../gamestars/img/memoji 1.png" alt="wie het heeft gemaakt de review">By Tyler Hicks on October 10, 2013 at 5:50PM PDT</h5>
       <p>League of Legends is not just a game: it's a cutthroat competitive digital sport where the winners roar in victory and the losers whimper in defeat.
          You don't need to play on the same level as the pros to experience the thrills of these online battlegrounds, however. 
          Blending elements of action role-playing, real-time strategy, and tower defense games into an engrossing amalgam of awesome, League of Legends is a free-to-play game that ensures each play session yields a unique and explosive experience.<br>
         <br>
        Each player in a match controls a single champion. 
        In the default game mode, Summoner's Rift, two teams of five champions are pitted against each another with the ultimate goal of destroying the opposing team's nexus, which is guarded by three lanes of towers. 
        The catch is that at the start of a match, your champion is only level 1 with no items to back up his or her quest for victory.
         To power up to a level sufficient enough to take on the enemy's base, a champion must first focus on killing AI-controlled minions for gold and experience.</p>

        <h1>counter strike</h1>

        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is still free-to-play, but you'll have to pay the piper if you want to play the game's ranked modes. 
        Valve recently announced that free players will be restricted from earning XP, drops, or ranks due to free players "hurting the experience" of other players.<br>
        <br>
        "Along with all the gameplay that we made available for free, new players had access to drops, Ranks, Skill Groups, and a free path to Prime matchmaking," the blog post announcing the change reads in part. <br>
         "Unfortunately, over time, those benefits have become an incentive for bad actors to hurt the experience of both new and existing players.
          So today we’re revising the offering for new players."

       <h1>valorant</h1>

       Think Counter-Strike with hero elements.
        That's the elevator pitch for Valorant, Riot Games' debut on the competitive first-person shooter scene.
         I say that not to disparage Valorant, though.
          In fact, that's what I love most about it, especially since it executes on the formula extremely well.
           Valorant thrives because of tight, tactical gameplay and a mix of character-based abilities that provide a necessary strategic layer.
            Although it's a slim package with limited features and barren presentation, Valorant has the potential to be great.<br>
           <br>
           The core mode of Valorant revolves around five-on-five matches in a best of 25 rounds with two teams of attackers and defenders of bomb sites, switching sides about halfway through.
          The stakes are high as everyone gets only one life per round, and the focus on precise gunplay with low time-to-kill leaves little margin for error. 
         Teams must account for buying guns, armor, and ability charges based on money allocated (depending on performance) on a per-round basis.
         In turn, each round maintains a high level of intensity as the tide of advantage can shift at any moment.
